This application uses NPM to install packages.

After you have cloned the repo to your local directory, open the file to the root directory.

While in the root directory run ```$ npm i ``` - which will install the node_modules to make the application run. 

After they have finished installing run ```$node reader.js``` - which outputs the master list of names.
